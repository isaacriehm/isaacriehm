# Systems Integration & Test Engineer

**Systems Engineer** dedicated to the architecture and validation of high-availability distributed environments. My work focuses on bridging the gap between rigorous systems requirements and operational reality through comprehensive Integration & Test (I&T) methodologies.

I specialize in designing fault-tolerant architectures, engineering real-time simulation environments, and executing "Black Box" validation to ensure system reliability under adverse conditions.
